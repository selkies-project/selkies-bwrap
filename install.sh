# Installs Steam and proot-bwrap into a Debian-based image or system.
#
# Steam's launcher package comes from Valve's repository, which the package
# itself registers, together with the 32-bit host libraries the 32-bit client
# and games need and the libraries Steam's metapackages only recommend but
# games reach for (Vulkan, EGL, video acceleration and XKB of both
# architectures). fakechroot is installed for the hosts that deny ptrace.
# steamdeps, the client's dependency check, would drive apt through pkexec at
# every start; the system carries what it checks for, so it is diverted to a
# stub that answers that everything is there. proot-bwrap is installed
# beside this script's copy, or downloaded from the repository when run alone,
# and Steam's own launcher is diverted so that every way of starting Steam --
# the menu entry, a steam:// link, a shell -- names it. Without that, Steam's
# requirements check finds no working bubblewrap and refuses to start with
# "Steam now requires user namespaces to be enabled".
#
# Run as root, or under fakeroot in a rootless image build.

# The launcher is a symbolic link to the client's own script; diverting it

# name from the name it was started as and refuses to run under any other, and
# a shell script cannot be given a different one -- the kernel hands the
# interpreter the script's own path -- so the replacement starts it through a
