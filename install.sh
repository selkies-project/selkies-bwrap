# Installs Steam and proot-bwrap into a Debian-based image or system.
#
# Steam's launcher package comes from Valve's repository, which the package
# itself registers, together with the 32-bit host libraries the 32-bit client
# and games need and the libraries Steam's metapackages only recommend but
# games reach for (Vulkan, EGL, video acceleration and XKB of both
# architectures). fakechroot is installed for the hosts that deny ptrace, and
# proot -- what runs a program fakechroot cannot be preloaded into -- is built
# here, since the packaged one is from 2018 and one that leaves its own loader
# named in AT_EXECFN breaks every applet of the multi-call coreutils recent
# Ubuntu ships. steamdeps, the client's dependency check, would drive apt
# through pkexec at every start; the system carries what it checks for, so it
# is diverted to a stub that answers that everything is there. proot-bwrap is
# installed beside this script's copy, or downloaded from the repository when
# run alone, and Steam's own launcher is diverted so that every way of
# starting Steam -- the menu entry, a steam:// link, a shell -- names it.
# Without that, Steam's requirements check finds no working bubblewrap and
# refuses to start with "Steam now requires user namespaces to be enabled".
#
# Run as root, or under fakeroot in a rootless image build.
