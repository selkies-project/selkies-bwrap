# Builds proot from the source install.sh uses, with the patches this
# repository still carries, and asks a program traced by it for its own name.
# Every released proot answers with its own loader's temp file, which the
# multi-call coreutils of Ubuntu 25.10 and later read to decide which tool
# they are. Both routes to that name are checked: prctl(PR_GET_AUXV), which a
# kernel 6.4 or newer answers, and /proc/self/auxv, which is where an older
# one is read instead.
#
# usage: proot-check.sh [--build DIR] [--proot PROOT]
#
# --proot checks a proot that is already built instead of building one.
